# 4.2 sending rays into the scene
- imagine your screen (viewport) as a grid through which you look into the 3d world
- eye to screen (viewport) distance is known as focal length
- set image width and aspect-ratio and calculate the height, this makes scaling easy
- viewport-width is calculated from viewport-height and actual image aspect ratio
- suggested read https://alvyray.com/Memos/CG/Microsoft/6_pixel.pdf
- 3d coordinates follow the right hand system with -z going into the screen
- image (viewport) coordinates have y axis pointing downwards with top left point being (0,0)
- pixel spacing is the distance between two adjacent pixels, square pixels are standard
- the ray passes through the center of the square pixel
- keep a notebook and pen around when reading/writing graphics, coordinates can be a bit tricky.
